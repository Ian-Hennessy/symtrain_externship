    - Additional Features: 
        - Mouse location and tracking feature to inform model's tagging of specific features and their function 
            - Listener for when a new frame is reached -> record mouse location and notate something like "switches to page x"
        - Audio-to-text model to take in recording of customer interaction and inform feature tagging
    - Rigorous testing of layout extractor 
    - Custom training loop for specific or more commonly visited pages, or even purpose-built omniparser models for 
    customers based on their webpages
